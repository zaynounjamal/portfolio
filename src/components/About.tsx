            Hello! I'm Zaynoun, a full-stack developer with a passion for creating powerful, elegant digital solutions. Currently in my final year pursuing a Computer Science degree at the Lebanese University, I combine academic knowledge with hands-on experience in modern web and mobile development.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My journey began with a curiosity about how digital products are built, which evolved into expertise across the entire development stack. I specialize in crafting responsive web applications with React.js and Next.js, building robust backends with Laravel and Node.js, and developing intuitive mobile experiences with React Native and Kotlin.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What sets me apart is my holistic approach to developmentâ€”I don't just write code; I architect solutions that balance performance, aesthetics, and user experience. I'm particularly interested in leveraging AI technologies to create smarter applications that solve real-world problems efficiently.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I'm continuously expanding my knowledge through research, contributing to open-source projects, and mentoring aspiring developers. I'm driven by the belief that great software should be both powerful and accessible.
          </p>
