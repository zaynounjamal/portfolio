            I'm Zaynoun Jamal, a full-stack developer with a passion for
            building powerful and innovative digital solutions. Currently in my
            third year of Computer Science at Lebanese University, I have gained
            extensive hands-on experience in web and mobile development,
            freelancing, and managing online projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey began with a deep curiosity about technology, which led
            me to develop a strong foundation in programming. I have worked with{" "}
            <strong>Laravel, PHP, MySQL, and ASP.NET</strong> for backend
            development, while leveraging{" "}
            <strong>React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS</strong> to create
            responsive and modern web applications. Additionally, I have
            experience in <strong>Java, XML, and Kotlin</strong> for mobile app
            development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond coding, I have built and managed multiple online projects,
            including{" "}
            <strong>
              e-commerce websites, mobile apps, and business platforms
            </strong>
            . My ability to lead projects, collaborate with teams, and solve
            technical challenges efficiently sets me apart. I also have
            experience in{" "}
            <strong>
              graphic design, social media management, and digital marketing
            </strong>
            , allowing me to create well-rounded digital solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am always learning and evolving, with a growing interest in{" "}
            <strong>AI and full-stack development</strong>. Whether itâ€™s working
            on a complex web platform, optimizing UI/UX, or mentoring aspiring
            developers, I am driven by the challenge of pushing technology
            further and creating impactful digital experiences.
